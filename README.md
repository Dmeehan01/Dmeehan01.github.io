I made a new GitHub account that only has this one repository in it so far. 
This repository currently only has the README file in it. 
To clone this to my PC I simply signed into the GitHub desktop version and selected my
repository that I made on the internet version on the Clone dropdown menu. This created a new repository on my hard drive.
