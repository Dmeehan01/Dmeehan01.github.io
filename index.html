		<p>I am a Computer Programming student and I also work as a Salesperson at Land Rover Cary. Some of my favorite things to do are playing computer games, spending quality time with my family, and playing Ice Hockey.</p>
		<p> I have been playing Ice Hockey since I was 4 years old. My father was born and raised in Michigan so as soon as I was able to walk, he threw me onto the ice and I haven't stopped skating since.</p>
		<p> I have a tiny bit of experience coding. I have taken several beginner classes on coding in languages like Python, HTML and Visual Basics. I have also taken classes where I have done coding in game engines like Unity, Unreal and GameMaker.</p>
